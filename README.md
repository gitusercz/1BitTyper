In 2024, I was following [Dániel Karsai's](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsai_D%C3%A1niel) struggle to the right of euthanasia. At one point, Hungarian Head of state Sulyok Tamás [wrote him a letter](https://telex.hu/belfold/2024/06/03/karsai-daniel-alkotmanyjogasz-elnoki-kegyelem-sulyok-tamas-koztarsasagi-elnok). As one of Dániel's weapon was publicity he shared the letter in a pdf document on his Google Drive.
I decided to reach out to Dániel offering the [Careless-AudioBookPlayer](https://github.com/gitusercz/CABP) for use. 
He replied soon for my e-mail. He was not interested in listening to audiobooks, but was interested in making possible reading alone and a tool that made him easier to communicate. 
So, I came up with two pilot projects. 
1. Following a [PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/24/eye-blink-detection-opencv-python-dlib/) tutorial, I was able to build a pdf reading application, that was using the webcam to monitor the reader and turn the page upon a long blink. Telling the long intentional and short unintentional blinks apart was not easy.

3. **1Bit Typer**   I have built this application first to wirk with a mouse button. I was to merge this project with blinking detection, which eventually did not happen.
